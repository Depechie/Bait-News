# Bait News
Today's headlines are a little on the crazy side. I've built an app that uses Xamarin.iOS and Azure EasyTables to see if you can spot fake headlines vs the madness that's printed every day in our favorite tabloids.

## Interesting bits

I wrote a Tinder-style swiping view as the component within the Xamarin component store didn't fulfill my needs. My control allows me to find cards for an index, get the top most visible card and quickly adjust the layout. 

The app also uses SFSafariViewController. A brand new way to show webcontent within your iOS Apps. 

Naturally the app makes use of Azure's offline sync capabilities.
